# Music_Genre_Classification

Music Genre Classification for the GTZAN dataset using ANN and CNN models

## Guide

For our code, it's best if viewed or ran as Jupyter Notebook or Google Collab.

There are multiple files in this zip folder. The file description of files are as follows.

1. Generate_img.ipynb generate melspectrogram images for all the audio files.
2. ANN-N.ipynb contains our models of ANN architecture.
3. CNN.ipynb contains our convolutional model that works well for grayscale images.
4. CNN_keras.ipynb contains our convolutional model that was made using Keras to work with RGB images.
5. ML.ipynb contains our Machine Learning model that uses GridSearch
6. 30sec_report.html, and 3sec_report.html are html report generated using Pandas Profiling.
